== Description ==
The whitelist/blacklist plugin gives you a strong layer of security for your website because not only does the plugin limits unauthorized user access to your site but also creates a log. The log helps to create new blacklist entries. The increase in your blacklist entries means a decrease in spam and security threats. So it is a great safety measure to start with.

It is a very handy plugin that you can add to your WordPress site for added security. It helps you to tailor your preferences about which email addresses you want to allow for registration on your site.

You can create a list of all email addresses or email domains that you wish to receive registrations. On the other hand, you can add a list for blacklist domains to not allow any registration from specific domains. Blacklisting is time-saving because most of the time you have already figured where the spam comes from. So you close those doors already. It is relatively safe also because you are not risking anything prospective.
